*[by Andrea Geary for _Cook's Illustrated_, September 2020

An extraordinary cake. Beautifully balanced: sweet but not too sweet,
light but with a fine texture, soft but somehow also sturdy.*

1. Adjust oven rack to middle position and heat to 350°F. Grease and
   flour a 13 by 9-inch baking pan. In a 2-cup measuring cup, combine:

    * [ ] 4 large eggs plus 2 large yolks
    * [ ] ½ cup buttermilk
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon vanilla extract

    Whisk with fork until smooth.

2.  In bowl of stand mixer fitted with paddle, combine:

    * [ ] 2¼ cups (9 ounces) bleached cake flour
    * [ ] 1¾ cups (12¼ ounces) granulated sugar
    * [ ] 1¼ teaspoons baking powder
    * [ ] ¼ teaspoon baking soda
    * [ ] ½ teaspoon salt

    Mix on low speed until combined, about 20 seconds. Add:

    * [ ] 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened
    * [ ] ½ cup vegetable oil

    Mix on low speed until combined, about 30 seconds.

    Increase speed to medium and beat until lightened, about 1
    minute. Reduce speed to low and, with mixer running, slowly add egg
    mixture. When mixture is fully incorporated, stop mixer and scrape
    down bowl and paddle thoroughly. Beat on medium-high speed until
    batter is pale, smooth, and thick, about 3 minutes.

    Transfer batter to prepared pan and smooth top. Tap pan firmly on
    counter 5 times to release any large air bubbles.

3.  Bake until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with few
    crumbs attached, 28 to 32 minutes. Let cake cool completely in pan
    on wire rack, about 2 hours.
