# Apple Cinnamon Batter Bread

*This one is weird, it feels like a quick bread recipe, but made with
yeast, and the result is somewhere between bread and cake. The top is
ugly; maybe can be fixed by brushing with butter and sprinkling sugar?*

In a medium bowl, stir

-   2 teaspoons active dry yeast
-   1 1/4 cups warm water

until dissolved. Wait 5 minutes. Add:

-   1 apple - peeled, cored, and chopped into small bits
-   3 tablespoons sugar
-   1 teaspoon cinnamon
-   1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
-   1 teaspoon salt
-   2 tablespoons vegetable oil
-   2 cups all-purpose flour

Mix well. Then mix in another

-   2/3 cups all-purpose flour

Cover and let rise 30 minutes.

Stir down the batter.

Scrape batter into a greased bread pan. This recipe overflows my loaf pan, so I make a couple extra muffins.

Cover the bread pan and let the batter rise for another 30 minutes or until doubled.

Bake at 375°F for 45 minutes or until it's 160°F inside.
