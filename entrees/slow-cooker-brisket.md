In a small bowl whisk together:

* [ ] 1/4 cup bourbon (marsala worked fine)

* [ ] 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard

* [ ] 1 tablespoon chili powder

* [ ] 1 tablespoon smoked paprika

* [ ] 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar

* [ ] a bulb of garlic, crushed

* [ ] 2 teaspoons onion powder

* [ ] 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin

* [ ] 1 tablespoon salt

* [ ] 1 teaspoon pepper

Use a fork to pierce deeply all over the brisket, then place in the slow cooker
and rub all over with the paste. Cover and cook on low until a meat thermometer
reads 185-200Â°F, about 4 hours.

Remove the insert from the slow cooker and let the brisket cool 15 minutes in
the liquid.

Transfer to a large plate or baking sheet and pat dry with paper towels.
Reserve the liquid (if you want to separate the fat, strain it).

Add to a large heavy pan:

* [ ] 1 tablespoon coconut oil

Heat over medium until shimmering. Add the brisket, fat side down, and sear
until browned and slightly crispy, 2-3 minutes. Using tongs, repeat to sear the
brisket 1-2 minutes on all sides.

Transfer to a cutting board and slice the brisket against the grain. Serve hot
with the cooking liquid.

*(Sandwiches: open sesame buns on a baking sheet, add slices of brisket to both
top and bottom halves, cover with cheddar cheese and raw sliced red onion.
Toast, smash together, add a little mayo and spicy BBQ sauce.)*

*(Consider tacos next time: chop it up, fry in coconut oil, and toss with lime
juice.)*
