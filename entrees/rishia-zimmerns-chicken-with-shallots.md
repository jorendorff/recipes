https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016135-rishia-zimmerns-chicken-with-shallots

*Classic.*

## Ingredients

* [ ] 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs
* [ ] 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon black pepper
* [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter
* [ ] 12 to 15 whole medium shallots, peeled
* [ ] 2 cups white wine
* [ ] 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* [ ] 2 tarragon sprigs
* [ ] 2 cups cherry tomatoes, halved

## Preparation

1.  Pat the chicken thighs very dry with paper towels. Sprinkle the
    flour, salt and pepper over the chicken.

2.  Melt the butter in a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet set over
    medium-high heat. When the butter foams, cook the chicken, in
    batches if necessary, until well browned and crisp on all sides. Set
    aside.

3.  Add the whole shallots to the pot and saut√© them in the butter and
    chicken fat until they begin to soften and caramelize, about 10 to
    12 minutes. Add the wine to deglaze the pot, stir with a large
    spoon, then add the mustard and tarragon, then the chicken
    thighs. Cover the pot, turn the heat to low and simmer for 30
    minutes.

4.  Remove the lid, and allow the sauce to reduce and thicken, 15 to 20
    minutes.

5.  Add the cherry tomatoes to the pot, stir lightly to combine and
    serve immediately.
