https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1016135-rishia-zimmerns-chicken-with-shallots

*Classic. Easily my all-time favorite recipe.*

Peel:

* [ ] 12 to 15 whole medium shallots

Halve:

* [ ] 2 cups cherry tomatoes

Pat very dry with paper towels:

* [ ] 8 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs

Sprinkle the chicken with:

* [ ] 2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1 tablespoon kosher salt
* [ ] 1 tablespoon black pepper

In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or skillet, over medium-high heat, melt

* [ ] 2 tablespoons unsalted butter

When the butter foams, cook the chicken, in batches if necessary, until well browned and crisp on all sides. Set aside.

Add the whole shallots to the pot and sauté them in the butter and chicken fat until they begin to soften and caramelize, about 10 to 12 minutes.

Deglaze the pot with

* [ ] 2 cups white wine

Stir with a large spoon, then add

* [ ] 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
* [ ] 2 tarragon sprigs
* [ ] the chicken thighs

Cover the pot, turn the heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes.

Remove the lid and allow the sauce to reduce and thicken, 15 to 20 minutes.

Add the cherry tomatoes and stir lightly to combine. Serve immediately.
