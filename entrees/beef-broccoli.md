## Best Broccoli Beef

Sauce:

- 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
- 2 tbsp low-sodium chicken broth
- 5 tbsp oyster sauce (this is very hard to find so you can also substitute hoisin sauce)
- 2 tbsp light brown sugar
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 2 tsp cornstarch

Beef and Broccoli:

- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut into 2-inch-wide strips with the grain, then sliced across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices
- 2 tbsp minced garlic
- 1-inch piece fresh ginger, minced (about 1 tbsp)
- 1 tsp peanut oil or vegetable oil, plus extra for cooking
- 1 1/4 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-sized pieces
- 1/3 cup water
- 3 medium scallions, sliced 1/2-inch thick on diagonal, optional

1.  In a medium bowl, combine beef and soy sauce. Cover with plastic wrap and
    refrigerate at least 10 minutes or up to 1 hour. Meanwhile, whisk the sauce
    ingredients together in a liquid measure or small bowl. In another small
    bowl, combine garlic, ginger, and 1 teaspoon peanut oil. Set aside.

2.  Heat 1-2 teaspoons peanut oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high
    heat until hot and rippling. Add half of beef to skillet and break up
    clumps; cook, without stirring, for 1 minute, then stir and cook until beef
    is browned around edges and cooked through, about 1-2 minutes. Don’t
    overcook the meat – cook until just barely cooked through so the meat stays
    tender. Transfer beef to a medium bowl and cover with a lid and tin foil.
    Heat another 1-2 teaspoons peanut oil in the skillet and repeat with
    remaining beef.

3.  Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to now-empty skillet; heat until rippling and
    hot. Add broccoli and cook 30 seconds; add water, cover pan, and lower heat
    to medium. Steam broccoli until tender-crisp, about 2 minutes. Push the
    broccoli to the sides of the skillet and add the garlic/ginger mixture.
    Cook, mashing the mixture with a spoon, until fragrant, about 15-30
    seconds. Stir the mixture into the broccoli. Add the beef back to skillet
    and toss to combine. Whisk the sauce to recombine and add to the skillet.
    Cook, stirring constantly, until sauce is thickened and evenly distributed,
    about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, sprinkle with scallions,
    and serve with white or brown rice. Enjoy!
