## Best Broccoli Beef

1.  In a small bowl, combine

    - 2 tbsp minced garlic
    - 1 tbsp minced ginger (a 1-inch piece)
    - 1 tsp peanut oil

2.  In a medium bowl, combine

    - 1 1/2 pounds flank steak, cut into 2-inch-wide strips with the grain,
        then sliced across the grain into 1/8-inch-thick slices
    - 3 tbsp soy sauce

    Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate.

3.  Prepare separately

    - 1-1/4 pounds broccoli, cut into bite-sized pieces
    - 3 scallions, sliced

4.  In a small bowl, whisk together

    - 1 tbsp rice wine vinegar
    - 2 tbsp low-sodium chicken broth
    - 5 tbsp oyster sauce
    - 2 tbsp light brown sugar
    - 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
    - 2 tsp cornstarch

5.  Start preparing rice.

6.  Heat 1-2 teaspoons peanut oil in 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high
    heat until hot and rippling. Add half of beef to skillet and break up
    clumps; cook, without stirring, for 1 minute, then stir and cook until beef
    is browned around edges and cooked through, about 1-2 minutes. Don’t
    overcook the meat – cook until just barely cooked through so the meat stays
    tender. Transfer beef to a medium bowl and cover with a lid and tin foil.
    Heat another 1-2 teaspoons peanut oil in the skillet and repeat with
    remaining beef.

7.  Add 1 tablespoon peanut oil to now-empty skillet; heat until rippling and
    hot. Add broccoli and cook 30 seconds. Add

    - 1/3 cup water

    Cover pan and lower heat to medium. Steam broccoli until tender, 4-5
    minutes.

8.  Push the broccoli to the sides of the skillet and add the garlic-ginger
    mixture. Cook, mashing the mixture with a spoon, until fragrant, about
    15-30 seconds. Stir it into the broccoli.

    Add the beef back to skillet and toss to combine.

    Whisk the sauce to recombine and add to the skillet. Cook, stirring
    constantly, until sauce is thickened and evenly distributed, about 1-2
    minutes.

    Remove from heat and sprinkle with scallions.
