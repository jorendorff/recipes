# Test Kitchen Strata

*A favorite from season 1 of the _America's Test Kitchen_ TV show.*


## The night before

Slice into half-inch slices:

* [ ] 1 loaf of French bread

Toast at 225°F for 40 minutes. Then spread one side with

* [ ] butter

In a medium bowl, whisk

* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] pepper to taste
* [ ] 6 eggs
* [ ] 1 3/4 cup half & half

In a saucepan, over medium heat, reduce

* [ ] 1/2 cup dry sherry

to 1/4 cup. Stir it into the egg mixture.

For filling, use:

* [ ] 1 package thawed frozen spinach, **drained**
* [ ] 1/4 cup minced shallots
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup shredded gruyere

or sausage and cheddar, or whatever you like.

Butter an 8-inch square pan. Layer bread, fillings, and cheese. Pour in
the egg mixture. *(When I make this, I end up with a little of
everything left over. Toss it.)* Cover with plastic wrap and put
something on it to press it down.  Refrigerate overnight.


## Baking

Remove wrap, bake at 325°F until puffy, 50-75 minutes.
