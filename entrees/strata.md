# Test Kitchen Strata

Serves 4-6.

*A brunch favorite from season 1 of the _America's Test Kitchen_ TV show.*

*Perfect for brunch because (1) you do all the work the previous night,
leaving you free to prep other stuff on brunch morning; (2) you can
double the recipe and serve 12, no trouble, and bake both in your oven
side by side; (3) it's too much food for a normal-sized meal, yet it
goes best with a few light, fresh side dishes—even more food—since it's
rather filling.*


## The night before

Slice into half-inch slices:

* [ ] 1 loaf of French bread

Toast at 225°F for 40 minutes. Then spread one side with

* [ ] butter

In a medium bowl, whisk

* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] pepper to taste
* [ ] 6 eggs
* [ ] 1 3/4 cup half & half

In a saucepan, over medium heat, reduce

* [ ] 1/2 cup dry sherry

to 1/4 cup. Stir it into the egg mixture.

For filling, use:

* [ ] 1 package thawed frozen spinach, **drained**
* [ ] 1/4 cup minced shallots
* [ ] 1 1/2 cup shredded gruyere

or sausage and cheddar, or whatever you like.

Butter an 8-inch square pan. Layer bread, fillings, and cheese. Pour in
the egg mixture. *(When I make this, I end up with a little of
everything left over. Toss it.)* Cover with plastic wrap and put
something on it to press it down.  Refrigerate overnight.


## Baking

Remove wrap, bake at 325°F until puffy, 50-75 minutes.

*(Don't panic if you put a knife into this and find it's very soft.
Fully cooked, this strata often remains more moist and tender than plain
scrambled eggs. If it puffed up, it's cooked. Taste it and see.)*
