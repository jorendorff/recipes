# Chopped Cheese Sandwiches

*Cooks Country, Oct/Nov 2019, p. 15*

*This is by far the trashiest recipe I have ever seen in an ATK publication. I love it.*

Oven to 400F.

Combine in a large skillet:

* [ ] 1 pound 85% lean ground beef (80% is too greasy for this one)
* [ ] 1 onion, chopped fine
* [ ] 1 tsp Goya Adobo All Purpose Seasoning
* [ ] 1 tsp Lawry's Seasoned Salt

I bet a jalapeno would be good in there, minus the seeds.

Cook medium-high, constantly breaking up meat into small pieces, until
cooked through and excess moisture is driven off, about 8 minutes.

Arrange on baking sheet

* [ ] 4 8-inch sub rolls, split

Spread

* [ ] mayo
* [ ] ketchup

Divide beef mixture evenly among rolls.

Now get this. On each roll add

* [ ] 2 slices of American cheese

I never have that, but mozzarella is OK I guess? Dying.

Bake until the cheese is melty, 5 minutes. Meanwhile chop the vegetables:

* [ ] iceberg lettuce, shredded
* [ ] 2 tomatoes, thinly sliced

Put those on the cheese.

Close 1 sandwich, using spatula as needed to keep ingredients contained within roll (sandwich will be very full). Starting from corner of 16 by 12-inch sheet of parchment paper (or butcher paper), immediately wrap sandwich tightly. Repeat. To serve, cut sandwiches in half through the paper and unwrap as you eat.
