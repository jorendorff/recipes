# Orange Glazed Pork Stir Fry

*I found [this
recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/food-network-kitchen/garlic-and-vinegar-glazed-pork-chops-with-scallions-5297648)
and replaced the vinegar with oranges.
Tried zesting the oranges once and it was too much. Orange peel is right.*

*Good with rice and green beans.*

Mix in a small bowl:

*   1/2 cup soy sauce
*   juice and peel of 2 large oranges
*   2 1/2 tbsp brown sugar
*   1 tbsp cornstarch
*   3 garlic cloves smashed or minced
*   2-3 scallions, chopped (whites and greens)

Set aside.

In a large skillet, heat to medium high:

*   2 tbsp coconut oil

When hot, add

*   3 red/orange/yellow bell peppers and/or small yellow onions, sliced
*   salt and pepper to taste

Cook, stirring, until crisp-tender, about 3 minutes. Add

*   4 pork chops, sliced 1/4 inch thick

Stir fry 1 minute. Dump in the sauce, crank the heat, boil until pork is
cooked through and glazed, 1-2 minutes.
