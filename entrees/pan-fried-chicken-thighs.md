# Made With Lau pan fried chicken thighs

<https://www.madewithlau.com/recipes/pan-fried-chicken-thighs>

Debone

- 12 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs

Trim excess fat, then slice the thickest part of the chicken thigh outward so you can "unfold" it, making a piece with even thickness.

Peel and mince:

- 1 oz ginger (a 4-inch piece with 1 inch diameter)
- 6 cloves of garlic (separately)

Chop into thin slices:

- 1 red onion
- 1 yellow onion

Combine in a small bowl:

- the minced ginger
- 2 tbsp oyster sauce
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp cooking wine
- 2 tsp salt
- 2 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp white pepper
- 4 tbsp cornstarch

Dry each piece of chicken with a paper towel, then place them into the bowl of marinade. Coat thoroughly, then set aside, meat side down facing the sauce, for 10 minutes.

**Cook the thighs in two batches to avoid crowding the pan:**

Spread an even layer of cornstarch on a plate. Coat each side of half of the thighs with cornstarch. Gently shake off the excess cornstarch.

In a large skillet heat on high until shimmering:

- 2 tbsp avocado or coconut oil

Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the coated thighs, meat side down, and cook until golden brown, 2-3 minutes.

Flip and cook on the skin side until golden brown, 5-6 minutes.

Flip back to the meat side and cook for another 1-2 minutes to make it crispy.

Push chicken to the sides of the pan. Add

- half of the minced garlic

Cook 10 seconds. Add

- half of the sliced onions

Cook 20 seconds. Add

- 1 tbsp cooking wine

and immediately cover with a tight lid. Turn the heat to high and cook covered for just 30-40 seconds.

Remove. Repeat with the second batch.
