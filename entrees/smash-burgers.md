*Yup.*

1.  Get the buns and toppings ready.

2.  Mix in a small bowl:

    * [ ] 1 tsp kosher salt
    * [ ] 1 tsp seasoned salt
    * [ ] 1 tsp black pepper

3. Shape into four rough, loose balls:

    * [ ] 1 lb ground beef (20% fat)

    Sprinkle the seasoning all over.

4. Put in a large, heavy (heat-retaining) skillet over medium-high heat:

    * [ ] 1 tbsp bacon fat

    Wait until the pan is good and hot, then put in balls of meat and
    smash 'em good and flat.

    Don't smash more than once.

    Fry 2-3 minutes until edges are brown. Flip; the cooked side should
    have a fantastic brown crust. Top with:

    * [ ] sliced sharp cheddar cheese

    Fry 2-3 minutes on the other side until edges are brown.

Serve immediately.
