# Chicken Stir Fry

*Based on a generic recipe from [Mom on
Timeout](https://www.momontimeout.com/easy-chicken-stir-fry-recipe/),
with lots of edits.*

*The sauce is Family Approved, and I like that the chicken didn't get tough.*

1.  **Prepare.** Cut into 1-inch cubes:

    * [ ] 1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast

    Roughly chop:

    * [ ] enough vegetables to make 4 cups chopped (mushrooms, onions,
          bell peppers, carrots, celery cut on the bias, green onions,
          etc.)

    Mince:

    * [ ] 4-10 cloves garlic
    * [ ] enough ginger to make 4 teaspoons minced

    And, of course, prepare:

    * [ ] rice

2.  **Make stir-fry sauce.** In a medium bowl, whisk together:

    * [ ] 2 tablespoons corn starch
    * [ ] 1/2 cup cold water

    Add:

    * [ ] 1/3 cup black vinegar *(this is the magic ingredientâ€”look it up!)*
    * [ ] 1/4 cup soy sauce
    * [ ] 1/2 cup honey *(and/or brown sugar or molasses)*
    * [ ] 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil
    * [ ] 1 tsp red pepper flakes

    Whisk to combine. Set aside.

3.  Heat in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat:

    * [ ] 1-2 tablespoons coconut oil

    Add chicken, in batches if necessary, and season with:

    * [ ] salt and pepper

    Cook for 5 minutes or until cooked through (it took more like 7
    minutes for me). Remove from skillet and set aside.

4.  Reduce heat to medium and add another:

    * [ ] 1-2 tablespoons coconut oil

    Cook the vegetables. (For reference, the order to add vegetables to
    the skillet when stir-frying is: mushrooms, peppers, carrots,
    onions, celery, scallions, and garlic and ginger literally at the
    last minute.)

5.  Add chicken back to the skillet.

    Give the stir-fry sauce one last whisk and pour it in. Stir everything to combine.

    Bring to a boil and boil one minute, stirring occasionally.
