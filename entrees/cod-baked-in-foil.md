# Cod baked in foil with potatoes, zucchini, and sun-dried tomatoes

*This is proposed as a 30-minute recipe but that's impossible. The
shallot is overpowered in here; I don't know what they were
thinking. But yeah, it was yummy!*

Adjust oven rack to lowest position and set oven to 450F.

Line rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil. On prepared sheet, toss:

* [ ] 1 pound extra-small Yukon Gold potatoes (ideally 1-inch or less in diameter)
* [ ] 1 tbsp oil from oil-packed sun-dried tomatoes (doesn't actually convey any flavor to speak of)
* [ ] 1/4 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper

Arrange around perimeter of sheet. Roast until potatoes start to brown,
10 minutes.

Meanwhile, cut eight 12-inch squares of foil. Place four on
counter. Distribute evenly among them:

* [ ] 2 zucchini, sliced into 1/2-inch-thick rounds
* [ ] 1 shallot, halved and sliced thin
* [ ] 1/2 cup frozen peas

Sprinkle:

* [ ] 4 (6-ounce) skinless cod fillets, 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/4 tsp pepper

Put fillets on vegetables. Top with

* [ ] 1/2 cup minced sun-dried tomatoes
* [ ] 2 tbsp oil from the tomatoes

Place remaining 4 squares of foil on top. Make sealed packets. Transfer
to center of sheet with potatoes. Bake until fish flakes apart when
gently prodded with paring knife and registers 140 degrees, about 15
minutes *(for me it took much longer)*.

Sprinkle with

* [ ] 2 tbsp chopped fresh basil

and serve with

* [ ] lemon wedges
