# Blackout white beans and greens with smoked chicken

*January 28, 2026*

*To make this recipe in authentic Nashville fashion requires three people: one competent cook for the beans and two chuckleheads to man the grill. Also, wait for an ice storm causing an extended power outage in the dead of winter. For best results, there should be two inches of ice and snow on the ground, and your home should be among the 100,000+ households that have been without power for days.*

Fill a big bowl with water and add
* [ ] about 3 generous tbsp kosher salt
* [ ] 1 lb great northern beans

Let soak for two nights, since it's very cold in your unheated house. (If you make this in a house with heat, one night will do and actually the beans might ferment if left out two nights running.)

Start cooking around 2:30 PM, figuring this should be plenty of time and there's no way you'll have to finish cooking in the dark.

In a 2-quart plastic box, combine:

* [ ] 2-3 lbs. chicken thighs
* [ ] enough olive oil to coat
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic, chopped into matchsticks
* [ ] 1/2 tsp dried oregano, crushed with your hand, man style
* [ ] 1 tsp dried basil, crushed
* [ ] 1/2 tsp dried thyme, crushed
* [ ] 2/3 cup full-fat greek yogurt

Stir, leave lying around for a while someplace cold (i.e. anywhere).

Drain the beans. Transfer to a large pot. Cover with water by about an inch.

Bring to a boil over wood burning stove, perhaps medium low heat. Simmer covered until almost tender but still a bit crunchy inside. Crack the lid and continue simmering until the water is below the level of the top layer beans, but not gone, and beans are creamy, at least two hours. If the liquid is disappearing too fast, or the beans aren't getting tender, put the lid back on or add water.

Add:
* [ ] salt to taste
* [ ] 1 bunch of flat kale (lacinato), cut into 1-1/2-inch to 2-inch pieces

Gently stir that in, as the beans are very soft. Some of the beans will break up as you stir, thickening the sauce.

Add, in a bundle on top, to be removed later:
* [ ] 4 sprigs fresh sage, whole
* [ ] 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary, whole (3-4 inches)

Add:
* [ ] 1/2 tsp red pepper flakes, or to taste

Add:
* [ ] chicken broth
as necessary to bring the liquid level just to the top of the beans.

Simmer another 15 minutes over the same medium-low heat. Gently stir to rotate the kale.

Simmer another 15 minutes. Remove herbs, taste for salt.

**Meanwhile:**

Place a round kettle-style charcoal grill outside, in the freezing cold. Remove the grill from the grill. Cleverly add:

* [ ] hot embers and ashes from the wood-burning stove
* [ ] charcoal

It won't catch. It's too cold. Add

* [ ] 8-10 briquettes of match-light charcoal

Waste several matches trying to match-light it. When it finally lights, add:

* [ ] a 6-inch stick of cedar wood you previously found on the side of the road (optional)

The temperature should come up to about 350&deg;F. After putting the grill back in the grill, make sure to close the lid and kill the fire.

Add:
* [ ] the marinated chicken thighs

Hope for the best. Watch the temperature decline. Wince. Fret. Try various irrelevant tricks to get the charcoal to catch.

When it gets down to 275&deg; (about 15 minutes), in desperation, go inside and sheepishly ask for

* [ ] a hot log from the fire

Promise to replace it. Select a log that is not actively emitting flames, but mostly burned, totally black on the outside and almost falling apart. Using fireplace tools, transfer the log to the ash bucket, then gawp in alarm as smoke rapidly fills the house. Run outside with the bucket, trailing billows of smoke behind you. Carefully lift the grill, with chicken thighs, from the grill. Add the hot log. Replace the grill and close the lid. Look at your grill partner. Shrug.

Realize there is now a log-shaped zone of blazing heat inside the otherwise cool grill. Occaionally crack the lid and rotate the grill within to keep the chicken from burning.

Cook until an undeserved miracle occurs and the meat becomes smoky and delicious, 5 or 10 minutes more on each side. Remove.

Serve with the beans and:
* [ ] a squeeze of lemon juice
* [ ] fresh parmesan cheese

----

After dinner, go out to put away the grill and discover that all that charcoal finally caught and it's now at 450&deg;. Toast

* [ ] marshmallows

and eat with

* [ ] hobnobs
