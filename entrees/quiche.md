*(I did not follow either recipe at all. Here is my wildly different
recipe.)*

Oven to 350ÂºF (and take your pie crust out of the fridge).

Mix:

*   4 eggs, lightly beaten
*   1 cup half and half
*   1/2 cup mayo

Pour over:

*   1/2 cup shredded cheese (feta is good too)
*   1 cup tasty stuff of your choice (cooked chopped bacon, cooked and drained spinach, onions, etc.)

Put in a pie plate:

*   1 uncooked storebought pie crust

Pierce bottom with a fork to avoid bubbles. Bake it empty for 8 minutes,
then add the mixture and bake 30-45 minutes more, until brown on top.
