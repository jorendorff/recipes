# Jewish American Pot Roast

*via NYT Cooking. Recipe from Mimi Sheraton, adapted by Julia Moskin.*

Takes 4 hours. Serve with mashed potatoes and green beans.

Roughly chop:

* [ ] 2 large onions
* [ ] 6 cloves garlic

Peel and cut into thick slices or chunks:

* [ ] 2 large carrots

Heat oven to 300 degress.

Pat dry:

* [ ] 4 lbs beef chuck roast or brisket, in one piece

In a large Dutch oven, heat

* [ ] 1 tbsp oil

over medium-high heat until it shimmers. Brown the beef on both sides, leaving it untouched until a crust forms. The meat should "sizzle enthusiastically" but not "pop or scorch". Remove and set aside.

Add to the empty pot:

* [ ] another 1 tbsp oil


Add the onions. Stir often, scraping the bottom, and reduce heat so the onions soften but do not brown, about 10 minutes.

Add the garlic and continue cooking, stirring occasionally, until the mixture forms a soft, pale brown mass, 5 minutes more.

Increase heat to medium-high. Add

* [ ] 2 teaspoons sweet paprika

Cook, stirring, until the mixture sizzles. Push onions aside. To the center of the pot, add:

* [ ] 1 tablespoon tomato paste

Cook the paste, stirring it often, until sizzling, then stir it into the onions.

Return the meat and its juices to the pot. Add carrots, thyme, and enough

* [ ] hot broth or water

to cover the carrots and onions (do not cover the meat).

Cover tightly. Bake 1 1/2 hours. Turn the meat. Bake until fork-tender, about 1 1/2 hours more.

Remove the pot from the oven and move the meat and carrots to a serving tray. Blend the contents of the pot into a smooth gravy. Heat the gravy through and, if necessary, simmer until thickened. Season with:

* [ ] salt and pepper

Slice the meat across the grain into 1/4-inch slices. Return the meat and carrots to the pot. Cover and heat through over very low heat.

For the best flavor, refrigerate overnight and reheat before serving.
