# Quick Pulled Chicken Sandwiches with Red Cabbage Slaw

*Cooks Country, Oct/Nov 2019, center insert, with my changes*

You'll need

* [ ] Brioche hamburger buns
* [ ] Dill pickle slices
* [ ] A supermarket rotisserie chicken
* [ ] (optional) mozzarella cheese
* [ ] (optional) a red onion

Carve the chicken and discard the skin and bones. Shred the meat into
bite-size pieces (should make about 3 cups).

Make [cole slaw][1]. Slice some of the red onion into 1/4-inch half-rings.

Toast the buns with butter and cheese.

In medium saucepan over high heat, combine and bring to a boil:

* [ ] 1 cup cider vinegar
* [ ] 1/2 cup water
* [ ] 1/4 cup sugar *(or try molasses instead)*
* [ ] one 6-oz can of tomato paste
* [ ] 1 tsp red pepper flakes

*(A splash of soy sauce is good in there too. Should try 1/4 cup, see
how it is. And some onion powder and garlic powder.)*

Cook until reduced by half, 8-10 minutes. Stir in chicken and cook
until warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.

Assemble.
