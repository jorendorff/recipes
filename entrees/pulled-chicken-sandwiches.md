*Cooks Country, Oct/Nov 2019, center insert*

You'll need

* [ ] Brioche hamburger buns
* [ ] Dill pickle slices
* [ ] A supermarket rotisserie chicken

Carve the chicken and discard the skin and bones. Shred the meat into
bite-size pieces (should make about 3 cups).

Make cole slaw. If you don't have a jar of cole slaw dressing, you can
make it from scratch. Combine:

* [ ] 2 cups thinly sliced red cabbage
* [ ] 1/2 cup sour cream
* [ ] 2 tbsp bread-and-butter pickle juice
* [ ] 1/2 tsp salt
* [ ] 1/2 tsp pepper

In medium saucepan over high heat, combine and bring to a boil:

* [ ] 1 cup cider vinegar
* [ ] 1/2 cup water
* [ ] 1/4 cup sugar
* [ ] 1 tsp red pepper flakes

Cook until reduced by half, 8-10 minutes. Stir in chicken and cook
until warmed through, about 1 minute. Remove from heat.

Toast buns. Make sandwiches.
