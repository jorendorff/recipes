## Cooking with Julia white bread

Made it with whole wheat flour. Fantastic.


## Oatmeal bread

https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/vermont-whole-wheat-oatmeal-honey-bread-recipe

Came out lovely. The cinnamon flavor is strong; I made a swirl of this
and the _Cooking with Julia_ white, and it was a wonderful treat.

I seem to remember this is my favorite so far. I might try 1/8 teaspoon
instead of 1 teaspoon sometime, to see if it's better as sandwich bread.


## King Arthur's 100% Whole Wheat Sandwich Bread

https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/king-arthurs-100-whole-wheat-sandwich-bread-recipe

Seed bread. I threw in poppy seeds, sesame seed, and flax seed.

It made an extremely tough dough at first, but after the first rise it
was very nice!  Doubling this recipe makes a bit much; the loaves rose
well and were enormous.  Maybe just 7 cups of flour next time (single
recipe calls for 4).

Very high-rising and very tender. Delicious.


## Pumpkin muffins

Olivia liked this one even though I just followed the recipe. I meant to
put in some molasses and some oatmeal. Used canned pumpkin.


## Chicken tinga and black beans

I like this recipe. Tripled the amount of garlic and used two chipotle
chiles instead of one. Used a little bacon fat when starting out the
black beans. It came out lovely.

I bet I could make a double recipe of the tomato stuff, cook it in a
larger pot, and get three chicken breasts instead of two.


1.  Peel and dice:

    * [ ] 1 large onion

    Set aside 1/2 cup for serving,
    then put **half** of the rest into a large dutch oven.

    Peel and mince:

    * [ ] one million garlic cloves *(I've made it with 12 and it was
        very good. Original recipe calls for 4; but this is exactly the
        kind of recipe where the sky's the limit.)*

    Put 2/3 of the garlic into the dutch oven.

## Oven Roasted Corn on the Cob

https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/oven-roasted-corn-on-the-cob-recipe-2103298

Roast in the husks at 350 F for 30 minutes or until tender.

Salt, pepper, butter.

*(This was delicious and a crowd-pleaser, IIRC.)*


## Ultimate Slow Cooker Pot Roast

*(There is nothing "ultimate" about this very simple recipe. It came out
tasting funny, probably because of the giant bunch of parsley I added
for no reason. To me, this seems like an OK first pot roast, but I'll
keep looking.)*

https://dinnerthendessert.com/ultimate-slow-cooker-pot-roast/

Season:

*   4-5 pound chuck roast

with:

*   2 tsp Kosher salt
*   1 tsp coarse ground black pepper
*   1 tsp dried thyme

In a large pan on medium high, heat:

*   2 tbsp oil

When it shimmers, add the roast and brown deeply for 4-5 minutes on each side.

Put in slow cooker:

*   1 pound baby carrots
*   2 pounds Yukon Gold potatoes cut into large chunks
*   2 cloves garlic, minced

*(I used 6-8 cloves, smashed, and it didn't really register.)*

Lay the beef on top.

Then add:

*   2 cups beef broth

Cover and cook on low for 8-10 hours or on high for 5-6 hours.

In the last hour, mix:

*   2 tbsp cornstarch
*   2 tbsp cold water

Add it to the slow cooker to thicken the sauce.

Or, when done cooking, transfer the food to a serving dish and the liquid to a saucepan with the cornstarch-water mixture. Cook on high for 2-3 minutes until the liquid is thickened into a gravy.

*(I instead went way off script: made a roux, added some of the pot
liquor, Worcestershire sauce, and some cream and pepper. There was a ton
of pot liquor left over.)*

Pour gravy over meat. Garnish with:

*   minced parsley (optional)




## Parmesan Hash Browns

https://www.yummly.com/recipe/Parmesan-Hash-Browns-1897749?prm-v1#directions

- 2 medium Russet potatoes
- 1/2 teaspoon sea salt
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley

Coarsely grate the potatoes on a box grater or in a food
processor. Sprinkle with salt, toss lightly, and transfer to a fine mesh
strainer over a bowl. Let sit for 10 minutes.

Using a wooden spoon or spatula, press as much water out of the potatoes
as you can and transfer to a bowl. Sprinkle with the Parmesan and toss
lightly with a fork.

Heat a large cast iron or stainless steel skillet over medium high heat
until hot. Add the olive oil, and then add the potatoes in an even
layer. Allow to cook without stirring for several minutes. Using a
spatula, check that the bottom is browned. When golden brown, flip and
continue cooking until other side is well browned.

That's what the recipe *says*, anyway...

### what i actually did

Sleep in. Grate two potatoes using fine grater. Soak in water five
minutes.

Transfer to colander. Moosh water out. Using dish towel, wring out one
big handful at a time, creating hash brown balls. Put balls in a bowl
with 1/2 tsp salt, some pepper, and powdered Parmesan cheese. Toss with
fork. So far so good!

Heat pan too long. Put in 2 tbsp coconut oil. Observe smoke. Wipe pan,
turn heat down, put 2 tbsp oil, but this time don't heat it long enough.
Put potatoes in. Think "hmm, that is not a lot of oil for all these
potatoes". Pan is not sizzling. Cook anyway for about 4', increasing
heat. Using spatula, note the potatoes have been burned black on the
bottom. Flip and try again other side, drizzling another 2 teaspoons or
so of oil. Again straight from raw potato color to black.

Add lots more oil (at least 3 more tbsp) and cook 3' or so, sizzling,
producing some brown. Declare victory. Go drop a kid off at school. Eat
cold and clammy an hour later.

Olivia says to parboil the potatoes first, keeps the flesh from turning
black like octopus (which these did, but I didn't notice because the
scorched parts masked it).

Not bad at all. I really want more of a crust though.
