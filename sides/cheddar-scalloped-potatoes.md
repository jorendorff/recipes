# Cheddar Scalloped Potatoes

*The best recipe. From a Cooks Illustrated 2020 holiday thing.*

Do not prep the potatoes ahead of time or store them in water.

Double this recipe: use a large Dutch oven instead of a saucepan, and
let the casserole cool for 30 minutes instead of 15 at the end.

*   Adjust oven rack to upper-middle position and heat oven to 425Â°.

*   Slice to 1/4 inch thick:

    * [ ] 2 pounds russet potatoes

*   In a large saucepan over medium-high heat, combine:

    * the potatoes
    * [ ] 1 1/4 cups heavy cream
    * [ ] 1 cup chicken broth
    * [ ] 1 teaspoon salt
    * [ ] 1/2 teaspoon pepper

*   Bring to a simmer, then reduce to medium, cover, and cook, stirring
    occasionally, until paring knife can be slipped in and out of
    potatoes with no resistance, about 8 minutes, adjusting heat as
    necessaryt o maintain a gentle simmer.

*   Gently stir in

    * [ ] 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese *(NOTE: you need 2 cups total,
          this is just the first half)*

*   Transfer mixture to 13-by-9-inch baking dish. Spread into an even
    layer.

*   **To make ahead:** Let cool completely, cover with foil, and
    refrigerate up to 24 hours. To serve, bake covered until heated
    through, about 20 minutes. Uncover, sprinkle with remaining 1 cup
    cheddar, and continue to bake uncovered about 20 minutes longer.

*   **Or make it now:** Sprinkle with

    * [ ] another 1 cup shredded cheddar cheese

    Bake until bubbling around edges and top is golden brown, about 20
    minutes. Let cool 15 minutes before serving.
