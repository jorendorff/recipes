1.  Move oven rack to bottom. Preheat oven to 500°F for 30 minutes.
    Prepare:

    * [ ] 2 lb. potatoes, washed, dried off, and quartered
    * [ ] 10 cloves of garlic, smashed
    * [ ] some sprigs of rosemary, chopped (optional)

2.  Add to a baking dish

    * [ ] 1/4 cup oil

    and heat in the oven until shimmering, 3 minutes. Carefully remove
    the dish from the oven and add potatoes, rosemary, and garlic.
    Stir to coat potatoes with oil.

    Season genereously with

    * [ ] salt and pepper

3.  Return the dish to the bottom rack and roast, turning occasionally
    so that the potatoes don’t burn or stick, until a nice crust has
    developed and they are dark golden brown, about 35 minutes. Remove
    the rosemary, stir to coat the potatoes with oil and break up the
    garlic cloves, taste and season as necessary, and serve hot.
