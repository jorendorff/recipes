*Entirely acceptable.*

Mix well:

*   1 1/4 cups mayonnaise
*   1/4 cup sugar *(originally 5-6 tbsp; that's a tad too sweet)*
*   1/4 cup cider vinegar
*   1/2 to 1 teaspoon celery seeds
*   1/2 teaspoon creole seasoning (orâ€‹ seasoned salt)
*   1/4 teaspoon black pepper

Toss with shredded cabbage, carrot, and green onion greens if you got
'em. Refrigerate 2 hours.
