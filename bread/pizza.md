# Pizza

*Hands-down the best thin-crust pizza I've ever made. This recipe is
from _The Pizza Book_ by Quint and Bernstein.*

*Two big warnings: 1. The book says not to bother making pizza if you
don't have a pizza stone or other oven-safe heat-absorbing surface to
bake them on. 2. The dough has to ferment for three days in the
fridge.)*


## Three days earlier...

1.  In a very large bowl, combine

    * [ ] 1 1/2 cups (400g) filtered water, room temperature
        *(this is actually only 360g but I think the dough is too wet)*
    * [ ] 2 1/4 tsp (7g) active dry yeast

    Let sit 5 minutes or until foamy. Then add:

    * [ ] 2 cups (300g) all-purpose flour
    * [ ] 2 cups (300g) bread flour
    * [ ] 2 tsp (12g) salt
    * [ ] 1 tsp (8g) honey
    * [ ] 1 tsps (7g) olive oil

    Gently mix. Dough will be wet and shaggy. Cover and rest 15-60 minutes.

2.  Using a dough scraper or wet hands, fold edges of dough into the
    center and push down to form a ball. Trnsfer to a floured surface
    and knead 8 minutes.

    Don't add flour; if it's sticky, flour your hands rather than the
    dough.

    You can use 1/4 of the dough for the windowpane test.

3.  Grease four small plastic tubs and their lids. Divide the dough into
    quarters, roll each into a ball, put in the tubs, seal, and
    refrigerate for 3 days.


## Baking day

1.  Put your pizza stone in the oven on the lowest rack. Put the other
    rack as close to the broiler as possible. Preheat to 500°F for
    45 minutes.

2.  Prepare your sauce and toppings.

3.  Shape the dough. Prepare a 16-inch square of parchment paper. Remove a
    ball of dough from a tub (you don't need to flour your hands, as it
    won't be that sticky anymore). Use gravity to shape the ball into a
    pizza shape. (It takes some practice to get gravity to produce a
    circular pizza, but blobby shaped pizzas taste great.) It's still
    sticky enough to stick to the parchment paper, and you can use that
    to stretch it a bit more. You want a 10-inch circle.

4.  Add toppings and get it in the oven—fast. The book says you
    shouldn't take more than two minutes from the moment sauce touches
    the dough. I don't know why.

5.  Bake 2-4 minutes. Once the crust is light golden, move pizza to top
    rack and set oven to broil 30-60 seconds. Remove from oven and let
    rest 2 minutes.

Don't forget to set the oven back to bake and let it heat up 5 minutes
before baking the next pie.
