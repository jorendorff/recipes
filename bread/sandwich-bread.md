# Whole wheat sandwich bread

*From <https://anoregoncottage.com/whole-wheat-sandwich-bread-101/>.
Makes good toast and sandwiches. I like the flavor.*

1.  In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine:

    * [ ] 2 1/2 cups water, 105 to 110°F.

    * [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast

    * [ ] 2 cups whole wheat flour

    Set aside to sponge for 15 to 20 minutes, until risen and bubbly.

2.  Add:

    * [ ] 1/3 cup vegetable oil

    * [ ] 1/3 cup molasses

    * [ ] 2 1/2 teaspoons salt

    * [ ] 4 cups bread flour (and/or whole wheat flour)

    Mix in mixer, adding 1 or 2 tablespoons of flour at a time until
    it's only medium sticky (no longer absurdly sticky). *(Sorry. I
    added over 1/2 cup of extra flour, a tablespoon or two at a
    time. But I tend to have a light hand when measuring out flour.)*

    Increase mixer speed to medium and knead 6 or 7 minutes. The dough
    should mostly clean the sides of the bowl by the end.

3.  On a lightly floured work surface, divide in half and form into two
    loaves, Transfer into greased loaf pans.

    Let rise until 1/2 to 1 inch above the edge of the pans, 60 to 90
    minutes. Preheat oven to 350°F during the last ten minutes.

4.  Bake 30 minutes.

5.  Immediately remove the loaves from the pans. Let cool completely.
