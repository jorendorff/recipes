1.  Get out half a stick of butter.

    In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together:

    * [ ] 1/2 cup warm water (105-115°F)
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon active dry yeast
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon sugar

    Rest until creamy, 5 minutes.

2.  Attach the dough hook. Add

    * [ ] 2 cups warm water (105-115°F)
    * [ ] 3 1/2 cups flour

    Mix on lo just for a moment, then add

    * [ ] 3 1/2 more cups flour
    * [ ] 1 tablespoon salt

    Mix on medium and beat until the dough comes together, then 10
    minutes more until smooth and elastic.

    Add, 1 tablespoon at a time, beating until incorporated:

    * [ ] 1/2 stick of butter, room temperature

    Roll the dough in oil, cover tightly with plastic, and rest until
    doubled, 45-60 minutes.

3.  Shape into loaves. Rise warm (80°F) until doubled, about 45
    minutes. Meanwhile preheat the oven to 375°F.

4.  Bake for 35-45 minutes until 200°F internally. Remove from pan to
    cool (or, the recipe says, you can remove from pan during the last
    10 minutes of baking, to brown all sides).
