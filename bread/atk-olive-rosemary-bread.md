# America's Test Kitchen Olive-Rosemary Bread

*With my edits.
This bread takes about 7 hours to make.
Like all ATK recipes, the recipe is incredibly high-maintenance.
You need a spray bottle and a baking stone.*

1.  In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together:

    * [ ] 1 3/4 cups **water**, room temperature
    * [ ] 2 tsp. **instant or rapid-rise yeast**
    * [ ] 2 tbsp. **honey**

    Add:

    * [ ] 3 1/2 cups (19 1/4 ounces) **bread flour** *(and keep the bag handy)*
    * [ ] 1/2 cup (2 3/4 ounces) **whole wheat flour**

    Mix it with the dough hook, on low, until a cohesive dough is formed, about 3 minutes.
    Cover the bowl with plastic wrap.

2.  Let it rest at room temperature for 20 minutes.

    Meanwhile, rinse, chop, and pat dry:

    * [ ] 1 1/2 cups of your favorite **olives**

3.  Remove the plastic, make a well in the center of the dough, and add:

    * [ ] 2 tsp. **salt**
    * [ ] 2 tbsp. **chopped fresh rosemary** *(Note: if you want the bread to taste like rosemary, add more fresh, or a pinch of dried.)*

    Knead on low speed for 5 minutes, stopping the mixer and scraping down as needed.
    Increase speed to medium and knead until the dough is smooth and slightly tacky, about 1 minute.
    If the dough is very sticky, add 1-2 tbsp. flour and continue mixing for 1 minute.

4.  Transfer the dough to a lightly floured counter and pat it into a 12-by-6-inch rectangle.

    Oil a bowl or container, at least 2 quarts in volume.

    Press the prepared olives evenly into the dough.
    Roll it up with the olives inside, transfer to the oiled container, and cover.
    *(Roll the dough up into a long, narrow, tight log.
    With the seam side up, roll the log into a coil.
    Transfer the dough, spiral side up, into the container.
    Cover with plastic.)*

    *(You are going to interrupt the second rise twice just to fold the olives into the dough.
    Pretty sure ATK is messing with us and you could do the folding right now.
    Let me know if you try it.)*

5.  Let the dough rise in a warm place until it has increased in size by 50 percent, about 1 hour.
    Uncover it and fold the partially risen dough in half three times.
    Replace the plastic, let the dough rise 30 minutes, then repeat the folding.
    Replace the plastic and let the dough rise until it doubles in volume, about 30 minutes.

6.  Without deflating the dough, transfer it to a lightly floured counter.
    Divide it in half.
    Shape into loaves.
    *(Roll each half into a rough ball; rest 15 minutes;
    roll each half up into a tight oval;
    use your palms to roll each oval, seam side down, from the center outward to form a 12-inch loaf;
    poke any olives that fell out into the bottom seam;
    pinch seam closed.)*

7.  Cover the loaves, seam side down, with plastic
    and let them rise until doubled again, 1 to 1-1/2 hours.
    The dough is ready when it springs back slowly when pressed lightly with a finger.

    Meanwhile, adjust the oven rack to lower-middle position,
    place a baking stone on the rack, and heat the oven to 450ºF
    at least 30 minutes before baking.

8.  Use a razor blade or sharp knife to cut three 1/2-inch-deep slashes on the diagonal
    along the top of each fully risen loaf.

    Spray loaves lightly with water.
    Transfer the loaves to the baking stone.
    Bake 15 minutes, spraying the loaves with water twice more in the first 5 minutes.

9.  Reduce oven temperature to 375ºF.
    Bake until deep golden brown and the center of each loaf registers 210ºF, 25 to 30 minutes.
    Transfer the loaves to a wire rack and let cool about 2 hours.
