# Kitchen sink tear-and-share

*(Adapted from [this recipe](https://www.fivehearthome.com/savory-herb-cheese-monkey-bread/) which was adapted from [this recipe](https://www.foodnetwork.com/fn-dish/2013/11/how-to-make-savory-monkey-bread). Olivia's idea. Fillings chosen by Kristen. She of course had a half dozen more equally wonderful ideas while we were making it, which I forgot.)*

Fun festive novelty thing in three easy steps!

1.  Follow steps 1-3 of the recipe for [Kindred Milk Bread](kindred-milk-bread.md).

2.  While it's rising, prepare the fillings:

    savory 1:
    * [ ] shredded cheddar cheese (*)
    * [ ] bacon, chopped fine
    * [ ] chopped green onions

    savory 2:
    * [ ] melted butter (*)
    * [ ] minced garlic (*)

    savory 3:
    * [ ] parmesan cheese (*)
    * [ ] pesto
    * [ ] leftover cooked chicken, chopped

    savory 4:
    * [ ] feta cheese
    * [ ] olives

    sweet 1 (put butter in this one too):
    * [ ] a mix of cinnamon and brown sugar
    * [ ] chopped pecans (*)

    sweet 2:
    * [ ] cranberries
    * [ ] orange zest (*)

    sweet 3:
    * [ ] dried apricots
    * [ ] sliced almonds (*)
    * [ ] honey

    Starred items are the ones that can stick nicely to the outside of a ball of dough; see below.

2.  After the first rise, tear off a ball of dough. It won't be sticky, thanks to the butter in the dough. Stretch the ball into a little rectangle in your hand, and pile/slather it up with fillings. Don't be shy; you want the fillings to be noticeable. Tip: Olive is a *much* stronger flavor than any of the rest, so heavy on the feta.

    Roll it back into a ball, tuck the ends underneath, and cover the outside with fillings too—the starred ones, anyway. (This is mainly so people can guess what's in each piece of the finished bread before picking one. Marking the feta-and-olive balls is an unsolved problem.)  Put the ball in a bundt pan.

    Repeat with the rest of the dough, keeping sweet-filled balls on one side of the bundt pan, and savory-filled balls on the other side. (Some of the toppings will leak out; this helps you avoid having a puddle of cinnamon sugar and cheddar cheese in the bottom of the pan.)

3.  Bake at 350ºF (?) for ...35 minutes? We don't know. Bake it until it's 190º F inside.  Let cool completely.
