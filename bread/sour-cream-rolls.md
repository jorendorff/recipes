## Sour Cream & Chive Potato Rolls

Combine in mixer bowl until cohesive:

* [ ] 1 cup sour cream or plain Greek yogurt
* [ ] heaping 1/2 cup prepared mashed potatoes, not highly salted
* [ ] 2 tablespoons butter
* [ ] 3 tablespoons sugar
* [ ] 3 cups all-purpose flour
* [ ] 1 1/4 teaspoons salt
* [ ] 2 teaspoons instant yeast
* [ ] 1/4 to 1/2 cup finely choppd scallion tops or chives, to taste

Knead the dough until smooth, about 5 minutes.
It will become fairly elastic, but still quite soft and sticky.

Cover and rise until quite puffy, 60-90 minutes. It may not quite double
in bulk.

Divide the dough into 24 pieces. Shape each piece into a ball, and place
in a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan, or two 8" or 9" round pans. Cover the
pan(s), and let the rolls rise until they're touching each other and
puffy, about 60 minutes.

While the bread or rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

Bake the rolls until light golden brown, 22 to 27 minutes.
