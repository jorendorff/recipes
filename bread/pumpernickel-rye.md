the pictures were not as dark and wonderful. The King Arthur
pumpernickel that seems most promising is

In a large bowl, whisk together:
* [ ] 3 cups bread flour
* [ ] 1 1/3 cups dark rye flour
* [ ] 1/2 cup cornmeal
* [ ] 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
* [ ] 1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
* [ ] 1 tablespoon kosher salt

Heat until warm, about 45 seconds:

* [ ] 3/4 cup milk

Sprinkle in:

* [ ] 1 1/2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
* [ ] 1 tablespoon active dry yeast

Let stand at room temperature until foamy, about 5 minutes.

In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook, combine the yeast
mixture with:

* [ ] 1/4 cup unsulphured molasses
* [ ] 1 1/4 cups milk *(this needs more milk i think)*

Mix on low until just combined. Add the dry ingredients to the bowl and
continue mixing at medium low until the dough begins to clean the sides
of the bowl, about 6 minutes.

Add:

* [ ] 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened

and increase the mixer speed to medium; beat until the butter is
incorporated and the dough is clinging to the hook, about 6 minutes
more. (The dough will look greasy.)

Scrape the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth
and it springs back to the touch, about 8 minutes.

Transfer to a buttered bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let
stand at room temperature until double in bulk, about 45 minutes.

Lightly butter a 10-by-5-inch loaf pan. On a lightly floured work
surface, pat the dough into a 10-inch square. Roll the dough into a
cylinder and pinch the seams together. Place seam-side down in the
prepared loaf pan and gently push the dough to the corners of the loaf
pan. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place until doubled,
about 45 minutes more.

Preheat the oven to 375Â°.  Discard the plastic wrap and bake for 35
minutes, until the crust is dark brown. Transfer the bread to a wire
rack and let stand for 10 minutes. Remove from pan and let cool
completely, 1 hour longer.
