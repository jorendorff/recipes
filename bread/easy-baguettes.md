### Ingredients

*   1 1/2 cups / 340 grams water (75 F/22 C)
*   1 teaspoon / 4 grams instant yeast
*   1 1/2 teaspoons / 10 grams salt
*   4 1/4 cups / 500 grams all-purpose flour (plus more for kneading)
*   Oil (for greasing the bowl)
*   Optional: cornmeal (for dusting)

### Flour Hydration

-   Pour the warm water into a large bowl or the bowl of a stand
    mixer. Add the yeast, salt, and enough flour to make a shaggy mass
    when stirred with a spoon.

-   Let the flour and water mixture sit for 20 to 30 minutes to rehydrate.

### Mixing and First Rise

-   Place the bowl on the mixer with a dough hook and mix on low speed for 8 to 10 minutes. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured board and knead it a few times with your hands until smooth and springy. The dough should be a little sticky (wetter) rather than too dry, so try not to add too much flour.

-   If you are mixing by hand, turn the rehydrated mixture onto a floured board and mix until the dough comes together in a ball, about 2 minutes. Knead for 10 to 12 minutes total. The dough should err on the slightly sticky side. The wetter the dough, the lighter the crumb.

-   Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl or another container. You may wish to mark your beginning dough height on the container so you can tell how far it has risen. Cover with plastic wrap so the dough does not dry out.

-   Let it rise at room temperature (about 75 F/22 C) for 45 minutes or until the dough has risen 25 to 50 percent from its original height (not doubled). If your house is cooler, this may take an hour or more.

### Second Rise

-   Lightly dust the counter with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Pat it gently into a rectangle and fold it, brushing off excess flour as you go. Fold it letter style, then make a quarter turn and fold letter style again to form a square ball.

-   Place it back into its container, cover and let rise to 1 1/2 times its size (not quite doubled), 45 minutes or more.

### Third Rise and Shaping

-   Lightly dust the counter again with flour and turn the dough out onto it. Do not pat it down as before but cut it with a knife or bench scraper into 3 equal pieces. The pieces should weigh about 10 ounces/285 grams each.

-   Pat each piece into a rectangle, brush off excess flour and fold the long edge toward you. Press to seal. Fold again to create surface tension around the torpedo-shaped dough. Seal the seam by pinching.

-   Place both hands on the center of the dough and rock the baguette back and forth while applying slight pressure out toward the ends. Do this a couple of times until the baguette is about 15 inches long.

-   Make sure the seam is well sealed, then place the baguette on a lightly floured (or cornmeal, if you prefer) piece of parchment paper laid on the back of a cookie sheet.

-   Prepare the other 2 loaves the same way. Place the loaves as far apart on the parchment paper as practical.

-   When the loaves are done, pinch and lift the parchment paper accordion-style, bringing the loaves close together. Dust the tops with flour and cover lightly with plastic wrap. Let the loaves rise for 30 to 40 minutes or until they have increased in size by about 50 percent.

### Scoring and Baking

-   Preheat the oven to 450Â°F. Place a rectangular cake pan or another type of high-sided pan on the bottom rack to heat and adjust the top rack halfway up. If you have a bread stone, heat it on the top rack. Heat 2 cups of water in a kettle.

-   Once risen, slash the top of the baguettes with a lame, razor blade, or even a serrated bread knife. The cuts should be at an acute angle to the length of the loaf and parallel to each other.

-   Add the loaves with the parchment paper into the oven. If you have a baking stone, slide them off the cookie sheet directly onto the stone. Otherwise, keep them on the cookie sheet.

-   Pour some hot water from the tea kettle into the pan at the bottom of the oven.

-   Close the oven door. If you like to spray the oven walls, do it within the first 5 to 10 minutes of baking.

-   Bake the loaves until they are golden brown, about 15 to 30 minutes (depending on the altitude where you're baking). Turn the loaves about halfway through the baking and remove the parchment paper if it's getting too brown and crispy.

-   Remove the bread from the oven and cool on a wire rack for good air circulation.

-   Eat baguettes within 4 hours of baking for best taste or wrap in plastic foil and freeze for up to three months.
