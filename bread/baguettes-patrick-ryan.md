# Patrick Ryan's Three-Day Baguettes with Pre-fermented Dough

*(This recipe does produce great flavor. I dunno, some baguettes come
out with good texture, and some are close. Changes for next time: •use
the right amount of yeast; •let water rest to remove chlorine; •adjust
refrigerator temperature.)*

## Day 1

-   450g bread flour
-   1 1/4 tsp (7g) salt
-   290mL water
-   3/4 tsp (2.5g) instant dry yeast

Combine in bowl with plastic scraper until it comes very roughly
together, dump out the mess onto the counter and knead 2-3 minutes to
incorporate the rest of the flour.

Cover and chill 24 hours.


## Day 2

-   500g bread flour
-   1 3/4 tsp (10g) salt
-   300mL water
-   1 1/2 tsp (5g) instant dry yeast
-   all pre-fermented dough, cut into 1- to 2-inch blobs

Combine in bowl with plastic scraper until it comes very roughly
together, dump out the mess onto the counter and knead 8'.

Soft, loose, and sticky is good. Don't add too much flour! Check for
windowpane effect.

Oil on hands is OK.

*(At this point, maybe try this: take 1/6 of the dough, shape one
baguette, prove 1 hour, and bake it.)*

Cover and prove in the fridge 18-24 hours.
Max 36 hours.


## Day 3

Divide the dough into 6 parts (250g each). Roll into 6 balls.

Take each, stretch the dough horizontally, fold stretched parts over,
then fold the opposite direction twice and tuck to make a sausage shape
and get some surface tension. *(I can't quite get two complete folds without
tearing the surface.)*

Rest 10-15'.

Sprinkle some flour on. Fold along the long axis two more times to knock
out some gas and elongate, then roll to baguette shape.

Rest in linen dusted with rice flour, "upside down" *(this distinction
does not exist for me)*, with a layer of cloth between baguettes, but
nestled together, so they'll prove up, not out.

Prove 1 hour.

Roll over to get them right-side up, load into baking tray.

Score.

Oven to 450°F. Use lots of steam *(preheat a pan on the lowest rack;
when putting the bread in to bake, also pour 2 cups boiling water into
that pan)*. Bake 20'. Baguettes come out fairly dark brown.

*(Original says 240°C, which is 465°F, but that's too hot on my oven—the
crust forms too soon, even with a ton of steam, so the bread can't
expand in the oven and comes out dense.)*
